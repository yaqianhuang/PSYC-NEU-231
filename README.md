# PSYC-NEU 231: Tools for Experimental Data Analysis 
Instructors: John Serences and Timothy Sheehan

Time/Location: Weds 9-11:50am, Crick Conference Room (Mandler Hall Rm 3545, on the Muir Campus). 

## First class Oct 3rd, 2018

## Course description
This course will introduce a set of commonly used data analysis methods implemented in Python using Jupyter Notebooks. 

We'll start with a basic overview of Git and the Python programming language, followed by an intro to various packages that we'll be using (NumPy, SciPy, etc). 

Then we'll learn how to implement some common analysis techniques such as bootstrapping and randomizaton tests, FFT, machine learning, mutual information, KDE, Bayesian models of perception and more.  

## Goal of the course
At the end of the course you should have a good working understanding of Python, a set of notebooks that cover each of the topic areas, and a Git repository that you can develop as you apply these methods to your own data in the lab. 

## Class time
Each week class time will be divided into an interactive lecture where we go over a topic and write some code together to demonstrate the functionality of a package (e.g. NumPy) or to learn an analysis technique (e.g. FFT). Then you will have the rest of class to work on a problem set related to the topics covered in the course. Most of these problem sets will be centered on analyzing real timeseries and behavioral data, much like you will encounter in a typical neuro/psych lab. 

Tim and I will be in class to help you when you get stuck and by the end of class you should be familiar with a set of general analysis methods that can be adapted for use in your lab. 

## Grading
At the end of the quarter, you should have a GitHub repo with all of your work from the quarter. This repo will be your final project and will form the basis for your grade. Our expectation is that you will have all problem sets answered and organized.
