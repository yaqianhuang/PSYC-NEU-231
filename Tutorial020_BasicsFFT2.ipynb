    "* FFT is a linear transform of the data and is just another way of representing the exact same information\n",
    "* Because its a linear transform you can losslessly go from one representation to the other (FFT and inverse FFT)\n",
    "* The frequency resolution (step size) is dependent on tmax, not on sample rate\n",
    "* However, sample rate DOES determine the ranage of frequencies that you can characterize, and sample rate has to be at minimum twice as high as the frequency of intereset (Nyquist)\n",
    "* That said, having a sample rate at double the frequency of interest is a minimum requirement, having a higher sampling rate is good, especially in high noise regimes\n",
    "* Given that frequency resolution (step size) depends on data length, you can easily miss a frequency-of-interest if you don't carefully select the length of your data epoch. This is also true if you are driving the system and you are off a bit in the driving frequency "
